# LucidTerm

**LucidTerm** is a lightweight terminal emulator written in **Rust**, created by **Luzifer Lawliet**.  
It is designed as an experimental project to explore **pseudo-terminals (PTYs)**, shell interaction, and low-level system I/O.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Spawn shells inside a custom PTY.
- Forward local stdin to the PTY and display shell output.
- Minimal design for learning and experimentation.
- Easily extensible for advanced terminal features (ANSI parsing, resizing, GUI rendering).

---

## 💡 Why LucidTerm?
This project is built for developers who want to understand:
- How terminals work under the hood.
- PTY systems in Rust.
- Low-level shell I/O operations.

---

## 🛠 Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed.  
Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnupamaSAbeyrathna/LucidTerm.git
    cd LucidTerm

Build and run:

    cargo run

🎯 Usage

Once running, LucidTerm will spawn a shell inside a PTY.
Type any command you normally run in your terminal:

    ls -l
    pwd
    echo "Hello from LucidTerm"

⚙️ Roadmap

Planned improvements:

    ANSI escape code parsing for full terminal emulation.

    Resizing support.

    GUI-based rendering.

    Tabs and session management.
